console.log(answer)	//here it gives 44hello it added both of them	
console.log(typeof answer)	//the typeof of the answer is string because it
 							//contains the answer value 

var answer = x * z;	//now here it is trying to multiply the string with number so inorder to do that
					//it converts string into number

console.log(answer);//it will multiply 44 * 3 = 132
console.log(typeof answer)//And the type is number
