					//whether it is true or false
					//This thing returns either true or false

console.log(typeof result)//here it gives the type as boolean
if (result) {
	console.log("It is not working"+result) //it prints whether it is true or false

//For fun lets just check for the type of console itself
console.log(typeof console) //It gives the type as object
